# Description

This web application is a resource to secure recipes from all over the world. Users will be greeted with a randomized joke from the spoonacular random joke api. Users will have the ability to sign up for the site if they have not already. Users will have the ability to log in with their personal credentials, which will direct them to their homepage. When the user logs in, they will be able to use the search engine to look for new recipes via the spoonacular recipe api. When the user finds a recipe that they enjoy, they will have the option to save the recipe to their page which will act as a personalized cook book. The user's cook book will have a list of the recipes saved with their respective links for the user to access.
